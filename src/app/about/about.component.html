    My name is
    <span class="b">Devon Bellizio</span> and I am currently a front-end software engineer at
    <a class="blue underline-animate-down" href="https://cardinalsolutions.com" target="_black" rel="noopener">Cardinal Solutions</a>Â in Charlotte, NC. As a developer, I enjoy architecting and building modular, scalable, front-end
    systems that are both performant and easy to use.

    level and in collaborative environments.
    <br>
    <br> When I am not behind the keyboard, I enjoy spending time restoring, repairing, and riding motorcycles on and off road.
    One day I want to travel west with my
