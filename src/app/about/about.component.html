    About Me
  </h1>
  <p class="ma0 f5 f3-ns fw4 fw3-ns near-black lh-copy measure-wide">
    My name is Devon Bellizio and I am a front-end software engineer at
    <a class="blue underline-animate-down" href="https://cardinalsolutions.com" target="_black" rel="noopener">Cardinal Solutions</a>Â in Charlotte, NC. As a developer, I enjoy architecting and building scalable, modular, and performant
    front-end systems. I believe having a strong attention to detail helps solve challenging technical problems both on an
    individual level and in collaborative environments.
    <br>
    <br> When I am not behind the keyboard, I enjoy spending time restoring, repairing, and riding motorcycles both on and off
    road. I have been taking things apart and putting them back together since an early age.
